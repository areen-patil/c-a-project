# c-a-project
This is a project for the summer analytics program <br>
Here I have tried to create a simple chabtot using pre=trained model and I have tried to fine-tune it but due to limited gpu resources coudn't complete the fine tuning , feel free to complete the fine tuning if you have the resources. <br>
I have also implemented without fine tuning but it is not as accurate
#NOTE
The file proj.py is the one wihtout fine tuning <br>
The file pyy.py is the file with fine tuning <br>
I have also uploaded the dataset that I have used and I took this dataset from Hugging Face
